Android Sliding Drawer
=======================

A direct port of [SlidingDrawerDemo](http://blog.sephiroth.it/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/SlidingDrawerDemo1.zip) for C# to work with [Xamarin.Android](http://www.xamarin.com/)


A drawer which can be dragged from top to bottom the screen with a slide effect.
