PopoverView
=======================

A Popover Controller for Android Phones and Tablets. It's an easy solution to simulate an iOS UIPopoverController 

A direct port of [PopoverView](https://github.com/lupidan/PopoverView) for C# to work with [Xamarin.Android](http://www.xamarin.com/)

You can set more things as well, such as the drawable arrows or the drawable background of the popover view, as well as the fade time
It also has an interface to notice when the popover appears or dismiss.
